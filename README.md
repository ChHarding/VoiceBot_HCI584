# Multi-Modal Chatbot Application: Voice-Bot

## Overview
This project aims to develop a multi-modal chatbot application that enables users to engage in conversations with the chatbot using both speech and text-based inputs. The chatbot will utilize speech recognition to convert user speech into text and employ text-to-speech technology to respond to users audibly. The chatbot is built using Python and Flask for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech:** Convert text messages to speech/audio messages.
- **Speech-to-Text:** Convert audio messages to text.
- **Chat History:** Display chat history with audio and text messages.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
