Project Specification: 
# Multi-Modal Chatbot Application: Voice-Bot

Overview

This project aims to develop a multi-modal chatbot application that enables users to engage in conversations with the chatbot using both speech and text-based inputs. The chatbot will utilize speech recognition to convert user speech into text and employ text-to-speech technology to respond to users audibly. Additionally, an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based chatbot will be integrated to enable context-aware and interactive conversations.

Problem Space

This project aims to solve the issue of managing calls while engaged in other activities. It helps individuals avoid distractions and ensures a safer interaction with callers when answering isn't feasible.

Version 1: Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech

This initial version of the application will be designed as a web-based platform. Users can provide input in speech, which will be converted into text. Subsequently, this text will be transformed back into speech, allowing users to audibly hear the chatbot's responses. This version focuses on creating a web interface for seamless speech-to-text and text-to-speech interactions, enhancing user engagement and accessibility.

Features

•	Web-based Application: Develop a web-based interface for user interaction.
•	Speech Recognition: Implement speech-to-text technology to convert user speech inputs into text.
•	Text-to-Speech Conversion: Utilize text-to-speech technology to transform chatbot responses into audible speech for users.

Purpose

•	Enhance User Accessibility: Provide a user-friendly platform for speech-based interactions.
•	Improve User Experience: Ensure clear and comprehensible communication by converting text responses into speech.

Task Vignettes (User activity "flow")
Task 1: User Input

Description: The user initiates a conversation by sending a message to the app.
Steps:
1.	User opens the chat interface within the app.
2.	User speaks or types a message to communicate with the chatbot.
3.	User clicks on a "Send" button to submit the message.

Task 2: Speech-to-Text Conversion

Description: The app employs speech-to-text technology to convert the spoken message into text for processing.
Steps:
1.	The app receives the user's spoken message.
2.	The app utilizes speech recognition to convert the spoken message into text.
3.	The converted text message is displayed on the screen.

Task 3: Text Response

Description: The app displays the converted text message, allowing the user to respond via text.
Steps:
1.	The user views the converted text message displayed on the app's interface.
2.	The user formulates a response by typing a text message.
3.	The user clicks on a "Send" button to submit the text response.

Task 4: Text-to-Speech Conversion

Description: The user-generated text response is transformed back into speech using text-to-speech technology.
Steps:
1.	The app receives the user's text response.
2.	The app utilizes text-to-speech technology to convert the text response into audible speech.
3.	The synthesized speech response is prepared for playback.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Flow

1.	Develop a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with users.
2.	Implement a speech recognition module (e.g., using libraries or APIs) to capture user speech inputs.
3.	Utilize speech recognition technology to convert captured speech into text format.
4.	Process the text input and forward it to the chatbot module for further handling.
5.	Utilize text-to-speech technology to transform chatbot responses into audible speech.
6.	Users can communicate with the chatbot using both speech and text inputs.
7.	The chatbot provides audible responses to users' queries and statements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technologies and Tools

•	Speech Recognition: Utilize speech recognition libraries or APIs (such as Whisper).
•	Text-to-Speech: Integrate text-to-speech engines for speech synthesis.
•	NLP Frameworks: Implement NLP using Python libraries (e.g., PocketSphinx, TTS engine, etc.).
•	Web Development: Create a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•	Version Control: Use Git for project management and version control.

Version 2: NLP-Based Chatbot

In the second iteration of this application, an NLP-based chatbot will be implemented. This chatbot will facilitate dynamic two-way conversations between users and the system. Users can continue to utilize speech and text recognition for input, but now they will also experience advanced natural language processing capabilities, enabling context-aware and context-rich interactions. This version elevates user engagement and delivers more intuitive and meaningful conversations.
